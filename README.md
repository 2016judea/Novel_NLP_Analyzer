# Novel_NLP_Analyzer
Short program utilizing NLP for paragraph by paragraph sentiment analysis of a novel (text file in this case, which I got for free from Project Gutenberg).

I originally started this project with the intent of utilizing NLP to determine commonalities of sentiment per the progression of novels written by a given author. I quickly realized after viewing the plot of the NLP output that the sentiment was all across the board and had a multitude of variation. Hence, I scrapped this project for the time being, but may come back to it on a smaller scale. Maybe sentiment analysis or noun phrase relationships among quotes from an author?
